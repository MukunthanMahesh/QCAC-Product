# Manora – Product Page Experience

## Live Demo (Temporary Preview hosted on Vercel)
https://qcac-product.vercel.app

## Description
A fully responsive, high-performance landing page showcasing the fictional **Manora Nova X1** compact workstation. Built to demonstrate modern frontend practices, clean component structure, and production-ready UI patterns.

Beyond the frontend, this project also ties together:

- **3D modelling** of the Nova X1 workstation (for hero renders and feature visuals)
- **UI animation sequences** for section transitions, hover states, and scroll reveals
- **Device responsiveness** across desktop and mobile layouts
- **Storytelling**, with sections that frame the Nova X1 as a product that delivers next-level computing
- **Industrial and visual design**, including lighting, composition, and layout choices that match a premium hardware launch

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (recommended)  
- npm 9+ (or another Node package manager)
- A modern browser with JavaScript enabled (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox)

## Installation steps
1. Install dependencies:
   - `npm install`
2. Start the development server:
   - `npm run dev`
3. Open the app in your browser

## Technologies Used

**Frontend:**  
- React 18  
- Vite 5  
- Tailwind CSS v4  
- React Icons  
- Custom CSS keyframe animations  

**Asset Pipeline:**  
- Blender (3D modelling + rendering)
- DaVinci Resolve (video editing / export)
- Canva (graphic elements)

## Challenges
- Integrating Blender-rendered 3D assets cleanly into the frontend.
- Achieving consistent responsiveness across devices, especially mobile layouts.
- Balancing smooth animations with overall performance.
- Implementing a scroll-aware navbar with seamless theme transitions.
- Building a simple, reliable loading sequence that syncs asset preloading with timing.
