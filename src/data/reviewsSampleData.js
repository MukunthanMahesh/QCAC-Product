    title: 'Desktop‑level power in my backpack',
    body: 'I replaced a full ATX tower with the Nova X1 and haven’t missed it once. I expected compromises moving to a 4.5L system, but the opposite happened—renders finish faster, games stay smooth, and ML workloads load and run instantly thanks to the 12-core NovaLogic SoC and the insanely fast PCIe 5.0 SSD. The unified LPDDR6X memory keeps big projects responsive, and the performance cores actually hold their 4.9 GHz boost instead of dipping under sustained load. Cooling is shockingly quiet and stable, to the point where I keep checking if the fans are even spinning, and the machine never gets uncomfortably hot. The 16.3" 8K 240 Hz display looks unreal, and I’m consistently getting full-day battery life without babying it. It’s the first compact system I’ve owned that genuinely replaces a desktop.',

    title: 'Unbelievably fast and quiet',
    body: 'The fans are so quiet that I genuinely thought it wasn’t doing anything, but my animation renders were progressing faster than they would in a small render farm. Battery lasts forever.. and the SSD is so fast it feels illegal.',

    title: 'Wonderful',
    body: 'The 8K/240 Hz display looked like overkill on paper, but once you see it in person you get it — everything is sharp and smooth. I get close to a full day of battery doing a mix of meetings, docs, and heavier tasks, and the fans barely make a sound. It’s compact, well-built, and surprisingly capable for something that only takes up 4.5L of space.',
